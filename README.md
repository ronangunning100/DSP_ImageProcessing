# Digital Signal Processing 
Image Compression via Transform Coding (DFT + Orthobasis Learning)

A MATLAB-based exploration of image compression using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and custom orthobasis learning, implemented as a final project for Columbia University's Digital Signal Processing (ELEN4810) course.


This project investigates how different compression parameters, such as patch size and thresholding, affect image fidelity, and compares traditional DFT-based compression against a learned transform approach.
